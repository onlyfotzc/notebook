Hi all, I'm a technology enthusiast born in the 1980s. I self-taught web development in college, laying the groundwork for my career. My exploration in computer science was thorough, with a solid foundation during my undergraduate studies and further in-depth research into cutting-edge technologies during my graduate studies.

I began my technical journey with C++ development and then shifted to the challenging and opportunity-rich field of smartphone software testing. Here, I not only honed my testing skills but also gained a comprehensive understanding of the importance of software quality.

The evolution of technology led me to the field of automated testing, where my passion and expertise have achieved notable success. Currently, I lead the GMS certification team, using my professional skills to continuously build a technically proficient team.

I am passionate about technology, keeping up with industry trends, and continuously learning and practicing. I believe that ongoing learning and innovation can drive technological development and bring new possibilities to the world.

On my notebook, I share my learning and work experiences, as well as insights into the latest technology trends. I hope my sharing can inspire more people's passion for technology and explore the future of technology together.

Welcome to my world of technology, let's learn, grow, and make progress together!
